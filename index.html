        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Brajesh Kumar, and I am a student at Amity University, Jharkhand, pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA). I completed my 10th and 12th grades from Kendriya Vidyalaya, where I developed a strong foundation in academics and a passion for technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            I come from a nuclear family, which has instilled in me the values of hard work, dedication, and perseverance. My journey so far has been a blend of academic achievements and personal growth, and I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in the field of computer science.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am particularly interested in web development, data science, and programming. I enjoy taking on new challenges and believe in continuous learning to keep up with the ever-evolving tech landscape. Outside of academics, I am an avid learner who loves exploring new technologies and applying them to solve real-world problems.
